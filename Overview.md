## Editing OSM  
[iD Editor](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/id-editor/)  
[JOSM Editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Introduction)  
[JOSM Workshop Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KPgQ1buFx2rS7HnvTa7OVZ-3WxBP6nsf7EcA9CUq70M/edit?usp=sharing)

    iD is good for…  
    - When you are doing simple edits
    - When you have fast Internet to load the imagery and save the edits
    - When you want to be sure to follow a consistent and simple tagging scheme
    - When you are restricted from installing a program on the computer you are using  

    JOSM is better…  
    - When you are adding many buildings (See buildings_tool plugin)
    - When you are editing many polygons or lines that already exist
    - When you are on an unreliable Internet connection or offline
    - When you are using a specific tagging scheme (or custom presets)
