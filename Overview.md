### Pick your poison: You can edit OSM with either the iD or JSOM Editor  
[iD Editor](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/id-editor/)  

    iD is good for…  
    - When you are doing simple edits
    - When you have fast Internet to load the imagery and save the edits
    - When you want to be sure to follow a consistent and simple tagging scheme
    - When you are restricted from installing a program on the computer you are using  

[JOSM Editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Introduction)  

    JOSM is better…  
    - When you are adding many buildings (See buildings_tool plugin)
    - When you are editing many polygons or lines that already exist
    - When you are on an unreliable Internet connection or offline
    - When you are using a specific tagging scheme (or custom presets)

## Data Collection
 
 [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/)  
 >Open Data Kit (ODK) is a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. 
 
 [OpenMapKit](http://openmapkit.org/index.html)  
 >OpenMapKit (OMK) is an extension of OpenDataKit allowing users to create professional quality mobile data collection surveys for field data collection. 

 [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/)
 >Excellent for written observations in low-resource settings.
